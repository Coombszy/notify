# Notify Version 2.0.0
It's finally here!

I've been slowly tinkering away at a complete rewrite of notify for some time now. It's been a fun learning experience as it was primarily an excuse to learn Rust. This new version also includes some new features that I think are useful additions.

Part of this rewrite includes new configuration as well as changes to the notification json(s). This means the new version is NOT compatable with the old version. See [Legacy Support](##-legacy-support)

## What's New?
  - Goodbye Python, Hello Rust! ðŸ¦€ <br> This allows for cross platform binaries, and hopefully improve resource consumption (Not that it was particular intensive in the first place).
  - Improved Config: <br> Configs have been updated to have better names and include descriptions. As well as add support/controls for new features.
  - Improved Logging: <br> Logging level is now controlled via an environment var, and has improved style/output.
  - Replaced days of the week Notification jsons: <br> Instead of multiple json files for each day of the week, they are all rolled into one `notifications.json` now.
  - Added Cron Expression Scheduling: <br> Notifications are now scheduled using cron expressions... finally, as it should of been like this from day 1.
  - Added Disable/Enable Notifications: <br> Can disable and enable a notification within the `notifications.json`. Does require application restart to apply.
  - Added API/Web Server: <br> Application now runs a web server that can receive POST requests containing notifications that will be pushed through to IFTTT. Can be disabled and enabled in configs.

## Upgrading
Configs and Scheduled notifications have completely changed. You will need to completely rewrite them.

For the config, you will need to source the new config from the repo and copy over any specific configurations you want from the old version.

For the scheduled notifications, you will need to completely rewrite your jsons into one single json. Use the sample provided in the repo.

Alternatively, follow the README and start from scratch. (It's probably easier).

## Legacy Support
The 'legacy' version of loggy will remain avaliable. Code will be found in the `legacy` branch and 1.x version of the docker image. Going forward there will be no new features for the 'legacy' version. Although, if any breaking bugs are found i'll eventually get around to fixing them.

Until the 10th of July 2022, `master` branch will continue to refer to legacy. Additionally, the `latest` docker image will still point at `v1.x`. On this date, `master` will be updated with the `rework/rust` branch, and the latest docker tag will refer to `v2.x` going forward.
